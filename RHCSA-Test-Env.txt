| Server setup | ==============================================
++++++++++++++++==============================================
==============================================

===============
| Networking  |
===============

* Set the hostname to server.linux-acc.localhost
* Configure IP, gateway, DNS
* Configure static name resolution such that FQDN of each VM resolves correctly (even without DNS) from each of the other VMs.

====================
| server run level |
====================
* The Server Virtual machine should boot into runlevel 3 (CLI only)

=========
| Grub  |
=========
* Remove Red Hat graphical boot and quiet args and add serial tty for kernel

======================
| Disk configuration |
======================
* Create 5GB partion using \dev\vdb using fdisk
* Create second partion using remiainiong space
* Using second partion create volume group VG1
* Create 500mb LV lv1 and format as ext4. Add to fstab with mount point /mnt/lvext4
* Create 500mb LV lv2 and format as xfs. Add to fstab using UUID with moint point /mnt/lvxfs
* Create 500mb LV lv3 and format as btrfs. Add to fstab using UUID with moint point /mnt/btrfs
* Create 200mb swap and add to fstab
* Extened lv1 by 500mb without losing data

=======
| ssh |
=======
* Create RSA 1024 bit ssh key for user root with comment root@linux-acc.local

===========================
| Create users and groups |
===========================
* Create users and groups on both your server and client virtual machines:

Users
=================
tester (UID=2004), password: linuxacc
ford (UID=2005), password: linuxacc
carter (UID=2006), password: linuxacc, shell tcsh 
reagan (UID=2007), password: linuxacc 
clinton (UID=2008), password: linuxacc, expires in +20 days from current date

Groups
=================
presidents (GID=2000; members=ford, carter, reagan, clinton)
republicans (GID=2001; members=ford, reagan)
democrats (GID=2002; members=carter, clinton)

====================================
| Create the following directories |
====================================

/share/presidents (use octal/symbolic notation)

* All four ("presidential") users must be able to write here.
* This directory must be owned by root and the group presidents.
* Only users in this group should have any access to the directory.
* Files created here should be owned by the group presidents.
* Users should not be able to delete files they did not create.
* This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that will permit it to be shared by multiple services.

/share/presidents/republicans (use symbolic notation)

* This directory should be owned by root and the group republicans.
* Files created here should be owned by the group republicans.
* Only users in this group should have any access to the directory.
* Users should not be able to delete files they did not create.
* This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that will permit it to be shared by multiple services.

/share/presidents/democrats (use octal notation)

* This directory should be owned by root and the group democrats.
* Files created here should be owned by the group democrats.
* Only users in this group should have any access to the directory.
* Users should not be able to delete files they did not create.
* This directory should have an SELinux fcontext that will permit it to be shared by multiple services.

=========
| chron |
=========
* Create chron task that runs every hour with top 5 CPU usage

================================
| configure yum ftp repository |
================================
* configure yum ftp repository with no gpg key
* install vsftp service and configure firewall

=============
| setup NFS |
=============
* Setup /share/presidents to be shared with client machine(s) using NFS protocol

===========================================
| configure server as a local time server |
===========================================
* Configure NTP service and firewall for usage of local client(s) 


==============================================
++++++++++++++++==============================================
| client setup | ==============================================
++++++++++++++++==============================================
==============================================

====================
| server run level |
====================
* The Server Virtual machine should boot into runlevel 5 GUI graphical

================
| compression  |
================
* Create tar file with gunzip compress of /etc/hosts file

===============
| Networking  |
===============

* Set the hostname to client.linux-acc.local
* Configure IP, gateway, DNS
* Configure static name resolution such that FQDN of each VM resolves correctly (even without DNS) from each of the other VMs. use scp to copy work from server

===========================
| Create users and groups |
===========================
* Create users and groups on both your server and client virtual machines:

Users
=================
tester (UID=2004), password: linuxacc
ford (UID=2005), password: linuxacc
carter (UID=2006), password: linuxacc, shell tsch 
reagan (UID=2007), password: linuxacc 
clinton (UID=2008), password: linuxacc, expires in +20 days from current date

Groups
=================
presidents (GID=2000; members=ford, carter, reagan, clinton)
republicans (GID=2001; members=ford, reagan)
democrats (GID=2002; members=carter, clinton)

=============
| setup NFS |
=============
* Permanetly mount remote NFS /share/presidents locally at /home/remote/presidents/

=============================================
| configure client to sync time with server |
=============================================
* Configure client to use server only as NTP source
